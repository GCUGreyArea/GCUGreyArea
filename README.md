### Test Code for AlertLogic interview
This is code I wrote as a code chalange for the Alert Logic interview. The brief was to write a parser that would count lelter freequency. It was a wide open brief, so I added documentation, unit tests and profiling.

### Pytho parser
This was a personal porject that I did to learn python. The code qualit isn't great, but I like the fact that it uses MongoDB and Docker compose to bring everything together. Needs updatinig at some point.
