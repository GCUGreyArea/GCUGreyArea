## Repositories

### Test Code for AlertLogic interview

I wrote this code as a code challenge for the Alert Logic interview. The brief was to write a parser that would count letter frequency. It was a wide-open brief, so I added documentation, unit tests and profiling. 

Repo: https://github.com/GCUGreyArea/AlertLogic/

### Python parser

This was a personal project that I did to learn Python. The code quality isn't great, but I like that it uses MongoDB and Docker Compose to bring everything together. It needs updating at some point.

Repo: https://github.com/GCUGreyArea/python-parser

### Rebgex parser

This is a simple regex parsing engine for complex log files. It uses Hyperscan to identify the anchor RE2 to match and extract values. It has been built and tested on Mac and WSL2 but not on native Linux.

Repo: https://github.com/GCUGreyArea/regex-parser
